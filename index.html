        <p class="description_text">This single-story modern Spanish-style retail complex is currently under construction. Located adjacent to the master-planned community of Copper River Ranch, this highly sought-after area experiences regular traffic from the affluent surrounding neighborhoods. Employees will enjoy convenient access to Highway 41, as well as nearby amenities including restaurants, shopping and daily services. The complex also benefits from being located on Copper Avenue, which was widened and improved in the summer of 2019. With a large amount of growth expected in this area over the coming years, this is your opportunity to get in at the ground floor and secure a prized spot in one of Fresnoâ€™s most desirable locations.</p>
